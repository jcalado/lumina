# Admin User Management System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully migrated Lumina from hardcoded admin credentials to a database-driven admin user system with role-based access control.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **AdminUser Model**: Added to Prisma schema with the following fields:
  - `id`, `email`, `name`, `password` (bcrypt hashed)
  - `role`: ADMIN | SUPERADMIN
  - `enabled`: boolean flag to disable users
  - `lastLogin`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  - `createdBy`: tracking who created each user
  - Self-referencing relation for creator tracking

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **SUPERADMIN**: Can do anything including managing other superadmins
- **ADMIN**: Regular admin access, cannot modify/delete superadmins

### 3. Security Features
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Users cannot disable/delete themselves
- Cannot delete the last superadmin
- Only superadmins can create/modify other superadmins
- Email uniqueness enforced

### 4. Authentication System Updates
- **lib/auth.ts**: Updated to use database users instead of environment variables
- **lib/admin-auth.ts**: Added role-based authorization functions
- **Admin Layout**: Updated to accept both admin and superadmin roles
- Last login tracking

### 5. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/users`: List all admin users
- `POST /api/admin/users`: Create new admin user
- `GET /api/admin/users/[id]`: Get specific admin user
- `PUT /api/admin/users/[id]`: Update admin user
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]`: Delete admin user

### 6. Admin UI
- **Admin Users Page** (`/admin/users`): Complete management interface
  - User listing with role badges and status
  - Create user dialog with validation
  - Edit user dialog (including password change)
  - Delete confirmation with safety checks
  - Permission-based UI controls
- **Users Menu Item**: Added to admin sidebar

### 7. Initial Setup
- **create-initial-admin.ts**: Script to create first superadmin from environment variables
- Automatically creates superadmin if no admin users exist

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `prisma/migrations/*_add_admin_users/`: Database migration
- `scripts/create-initial-admin.ts`: Initial admin setup
- `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`: Users API endpoint
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`: Individual user API
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`: Admin users management page
- `components/ui/table.tsx`: Table component for user listing

### Modified Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Added AdminUser model and AdminRole enum
- `lib/auth.ts`: Database-driven authentication
- `lib/admin-auth.ts`: Role-based authorization
- `app/admin/layout.tsx`: Updated role checking
- `components/Admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`: Added Users menu item

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`
2. Create initial admin: `npx tsx scripts/create-initial-admin.ts`
3. Login with credentials from .env file

### Admin Credentials
- Email: `admin@example.com` 
- Password: `secure-password`
- Role: SUPERADMIN

### Managing Users
1. Navigate to `/admin/users`
2. View all admin users with their roles and status
3. Create new users with appropriate roles
4. Edit existing users (with permission restrictions)
5. Delete users (with safety constraints)

## Security Considerations
- All passwords are bcrypt hashed
- Role-based permission checks on all operations
- Cannot perform destructive actions on yourself
- Cannot delete last superadmin
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
- Consider adding password complexity requirements
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement session management improvements
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Consider adding 2FA support

## Testing
The system is ready for testing:
1. Login at `/login` with admin credentials
2. Navigate to `/admin/users` to manage admin accounts
3. Test role-based restrictions by creating regular admin users
4. Verify security constraints (cannot delete self, etc.)
