# Album Slugs Implementation Summary

## What has been implemented:

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- ✅ Added `slug` field to the `Album` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- ✅ Created migration to add the slug column with unique constraint
- ✅ Migration applied successfully to the database

### 2. Utility Functions
- ✅ Created `lib/slugs.ts` with functions for:
  - `generateSlug()` - converts text to URL-friendly slug
  - `generateUniqueSlug()` - ensures slug uniqueness  
  - `isValidSlug()` - validates slug format

### 3. Admin Panel Updates
- ✅ Updated admin albums interface to include `slug` field
- ✅ Added slug input field to the edit album form
- ✅ Updated edit form state to handle slug editing
- ✅ Added API validation for slug format and uniqueness

### 4. New Album Routes
- ✅ Created `/app/album/[slug]/page.tsx` for slug-based album viewing
- ✅ Created API route `/api/albums/by-slug/[slug]/route.ts`
- ✅ Updated main page to link to albums using slugs instead of paths

### 5. Auto-Generation Logic
- ✅ Updated sync process (`/api/sync/route.ts`) to generate slugs for new albums
- ✅ Updated seed file to generate slugs for sample albums
- ✅ Created migration script to populate existing albums with slugs

## What needs to be completed:

### 1. TypeScript Client Regeneration
The Prisma client needs to be regenerated to include the new slug field. Due to Windows file permission issues, this might require:
- Restarting VS Code
- Running `npx prisma generate` after killing all Node.js processes
- Or manually restarting the development environment

### 2. Testing and Validation
Once the TypeScript errors are resolved:
- Test the admin panel slug editing functionality
- Verify slug-based URL navigation works
- Ensure existing albums get populated with slugs
- Test slug uniqueness validation

### 3. Navigation Updates
Update any remaining navigation components that might still use path-based URLs to use slug-based URLs instead.

## Current Status:
The core functionality is implemented but there are TypeScript compilation errors due to the Prisma client not recognizing the new `slug` field. This is a common issue on Windows and can be resolved by regenerating the Prisma client properly.

## Next Steps:
1. Restart VS Code or the development environment
2. Run `npx prisma generate` to update the client
3. Test the admin panel functionality
4. Run the slug population script for existing albums
5. Verify the new slug-based album URLs work correctly

## Usage:
- **Admin users** can edit album slugs in the admin dashboard under Albums
- **URLs** will use the format `/album/[slug]` instead of `/albums/[...path]`  
- **Slugs** are automatically generated from album names but can be customized
- **Validation** ensures slugs are URL-friendly and unique
